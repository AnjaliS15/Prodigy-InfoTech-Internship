Password Complexity Checker

Introduction

This project is a Password Complexity Checker implemented in Python. Ensuring that users create strong passwords is crucial to maintaining security in any application. A password complexity checker helps evaluate the strength of a password based on various criteria, such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This tool can be integrated into web applications, desktop applications, or used as a standalone script to improve password security.

Features

Evaluate Password Strength: Checks passwords against predefined complexity rules.
Customizable Criteria: Easily modify the rules for password strength, including length, character types, and more.
Feedback Messages: Provides informative feedback on why a password is considered weak or strong.
Includes a (not so)cool GUI: (needs no description).
