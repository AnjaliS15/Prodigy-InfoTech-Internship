Simple Keylogger

Introduction

This project is a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the `pynput` library. A keylogger is a tool that captures and logs the keys pressed on a keyboard. This can be useful for various purposes such as monitoring user activity, collecting data for usability studies, or for educational purposes in understanding how keyloggers work.
